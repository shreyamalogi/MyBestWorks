<h4> SKILLS </h4>


### 1) [Real-time Color Identifier](https://github.com/5hre9a/computer-vision)

The code uses OpenCV library to detect colors in an image and provides their RGB values and color names by comparing them with pre-defined colors in a CSV file. It allows the user to select a color in the image by double-clicking the mouse, and it displays the selected color's information such as color name and RGB values in real-time on the image.

### 2) [Zac-My Virtual Assistant](https://github.com/5hre9a/ZAC)

The virtual assistant is programmed to recognize voice commands and respond accordingly.
It is capable of performing various tasks like opening websites, sending emails, providing information using Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia, and more.

### 3) [Face Detection System](https://github.com/5hre9a/face_recognition)

The program uses the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces and LBPHFaceRecognizer algorithm for face recognition.
It can recognize multiple people and unknown faces, and displays the name and confidence level of the predicted ID on the frame.

### 4) [AI Attendance System](https://github.com/shreyamalogi/AI_Attendance)

An AI attendance system uses machine learning algorithms to automate attendance tracking in educational settings. It involves capturing data from various sources such as cameras, sensors, and using AI algorithms to process and analyze the data to accurately identify and record attendance.


### 5) [Google Logo Animation](https://github.com/shreyamalogi/google-logo)

Google logo drawn in turtle graphics with 6 circles arranged in order, each drawn using turtle's pen and fill functions with RGB values to match official logo colors.


### 6) [Automated Personalized Email](https://github.com/shreyamalogi/Automated-personalized-Email)

This project involves automating the mail merging process, where personalized letters are generated for a list of names. The program reads a list of names from a file, generates letters for each name, and saves them in a designated folder, ready for printing or sending.


### 7) [MP4 to GIF Converter for README](https://github.com/shreyamalogi/mp4-to-gif)

The mp4 to gif converter is a Python program that uses the moviepy library to load a video file and convert it into a gif format.
The program allows users to specify the start and end time of the video clip they want to convert and then saves the resulting gif file.
